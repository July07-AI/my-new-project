# Application for avoiding crowded peaks in public places

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

With the new restrictions in place due to the corona virus situation, it is even more important now than ever for everyone to feel safe while visiting public facilities. No one wants to visit a full supermarket or eat in a crowded restaurant during this situation. Therefore, we will design a new application that customers can use to check in advance how crowded shopping centres or public facilities are. Our aim is to guarantee a safer visit to these places and to develop an useful app. 


## Background

During the epidemic, restrictions for maintaining safe distances have become more and more important. With the help of this application, customers could check how crowded the shopping centres or the public facilities are and go there during a less busy time if needed. Also, when the corona situation improves, they could see how busy the restaurants and other services are to save time or avoid crowded places.







## How is it used?

The aim is to create a mobile application that will be used to prevent the transmission of the corona virus and to guarantee a safer visit in shopping centres or public facilities. The app helps customers to avoid peak times and to keep safe distances. In addition, later when the coronavirus situation is over, the app allows you to choose an off-peak time so you can protect yourself from a flu infection, for example. Motion detectors will be installed, and they will count people in the premises and transmit information to the app in real time. The app will be available for download from an app store to a smart phone. After this, customers can choose a shop, a restaurant or other public facility and monitor real-time situation, history data and forecast for the coming days in the mobile application. 

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Challenges

Information on all stores or public spaces may not be available in the application if the service provider did not want to join the application.

## What next?

We need to develop the app and get service providers and customers to test the app in their daily lives.
